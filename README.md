# **Bridging the Trust Gap: Leveraging Explainable AI for Personalized E-Commerce Recommendations**  

## **Overview**  

This project presents a flexible **Explainable AI (XAI)** framework for **e-commerce recommendation systems**, focusing on **transparency, user engagement, and adaptability**. Traditional recommendation systems often act as "black boxes," leaving users unaware of how recommendations are generated. This lack of transparency impacts **trust and user satisfaction**.  

To solve this issue, we propose an **adaptive XAI framework** that customizes explanations based on **user expertise levels** (Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, and Expert). The framework utilizes **feature importance scoring, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), attention maps, and counterfactual explanations** to provide tailored insights.  

## **Key Features**  

âœ” **Personalized XAI Framework**: Explanations tailored to user expertise.  
âœ” **BERT-Based Transformer Model**: Improves product recommendation accuracy.  
âœ” **Multi-Level Explanations**: Ranging from simple justifications to advanced counterfactual reasoning.  
âœ” **Improved Trust & Engagement**: Users understand how recommendations are generated.  
âœ” **Tested on E-Commerce Datasets**: Evaluated using Amazon Reviews dataset.  

## **Methodology**  

### **1. User Categorization**  
Users are classified into four levels:  
- **Novice**: Requires simple and intuitive explanations.  
- **Intermediate**: Prefers moderately detailed insights.  
- **Advanced**: Understands deeper aspects of recommendations.  
- **Expert**: Demands technical and in-depth justifications.  

### **2. Recommendation System Components**  
The system integrates multiple **XAI techniques** to explain recommendations:  
- **LIME-based Explanations**: Highlights key product features influencing recommendations.  
- **Attention Maps**: Shows important words and product attributes.  
- **Counterfactual Explanations**: Provides "what-if" scenarios to illustrate model decisions.  

### **3. BERT-Based Transformer Model**  
- **Utilizes NLP to analyze product descriptions and user behavior.**  
- **Fine-tuned using Amazon Reviews dataset for improved performance.**  
- **Enhances personalization and accuracy of recommendations.**  

## **Results**  

| Metric | Score |  
|------------|------------|  
| **Cosine Similarity (Recommendation Accuracy)** | **0.99** |  
| **User Engagement Improvement** | **Significant** |  
| **Trust & Transparency** | **Enhanced via XAI** |  

APRec, our **BERT-based model**, outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation models in similarity scores and interpretability.  

## **Future Work**  

ðŸ”¹ Optimize **training efficiency** for large-scale datasets.  
ðŸ”¹ Introduce **real-time multi-modal explanations** (text, visuals, and audio).  
ðŸ”¹ Develop better **quantitative metrics** for measuring explainability.  
ðŸ”¹ Improve **user feedback integration** for adaptive personalization.
